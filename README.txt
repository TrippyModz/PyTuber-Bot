IMPORTANT NOTES:

-KEEP YOUR BOT TOKEN(S) PRIVATE!!! IF YOUR TOKEN IS COMPROMISED THAT MEANS YOU MAY LOSE CONTROL OF YOUR BOT AND ITS PERMISSIONS

-When the script is ran the QWidget may show "Unresponsive" however this does not affect the playback and/or communication between the script and the bot.

-Check CMD logs to ensure bot token is accepted and you are connected to your bot (eg; Logged in as PyBot!) after confirmation the bot is logged in, the browser may take up to 60 seconds to fully launch. once the browser is launched and a URL is sent, any URL that is sent while the video is playing will automatically be added to a queue and play next with no external clicks (unless there's an ad)
